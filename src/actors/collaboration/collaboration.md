Multiple agents collaborating together to produce a single artifactâ€”in this example a JSON object containing a recipe, customer feedback, meal prep info, and other child agent output.

A Routing Agent capable of understanding what other agents are available for use and what work has been completed so far directs each next action in the flow.

A Summarization Agent is the last step of the flow, which analyzes the latest context and produces a human-readable summary.![alt text](image.png)
